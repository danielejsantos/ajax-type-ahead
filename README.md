# Ajax Type Ahead

### #JavaScript30

This is the fifth of the 30 day Vanilla [JS Challenge](http://https://javascript30.com/ "JS Challenge") by Wes Bos. The focus of the challenge was implementing a type-ahead feature that matches user input to cities and states(from a large array of city data). The city's population is also displayed next to the results.

The **technologies** used were:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

This is the final result:
